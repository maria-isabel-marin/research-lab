# Research Lab: Computational Linguistics and Conceptual Metaphors  

This repository serves as a **digital research lab** for projects in **computational linguistics** with a special focus on **conceptual metaphor analysis**.  
It brings together corpora, methods, and outputs from different research lines, including my PhD thesis, journal articles, book chapters, conference papers, and student theses (TDG).  

The overarching goal is to foster **transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration** in the study of how metaphors structure cultural narratives across social, political, and ecological domains among others.

## 🔬 Research focus  

- **Computational linguistics & NLP** applied to metaphor analysis  
- **Conceptual Metaphor Theory** (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980) and extensions  
- **Corpus linguistics** with emphasis on Spanish and multilingual contexts  
- **Hybrid methodologies**: manual annotation (MIPVU), cultural/narrative analysis, and computational tools (Python, AI, semantic networks)  
- **Applications**: peacebuilding narratives, sustainability discourses, cultural imaginaries  

---

## 📊 Methods  

This repository integrates three complementary approaches:  
1. **Cognitive linguistics**: metaphor identification using the MIPVU protocol.  
2. **Cultural/narrative studies**: interpretation of metaphors in social and historical contexts.  
3. **Computational tools**: Python scripts for text mining, network analysis (`networkx`), and visualization (e.g., semantic graphs, frequency plots).
